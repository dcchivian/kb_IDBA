    <p>
    This is a KBase wrapper for the
    <a href="https://github.com/loneknightpy/idba" target="_blank">IDBA</a>
    genomic reads assembler.
    </p>

    <p>
    IDBA-UD is an iterative graph-based assembler for single-cell and standard short read data.
    IDBA-UD is an extension of IDBA algorithm and is good for data of highly uneven sequencing depth.
    In its assembly process, IDBA-UD iterates from small k to a large k. In each iteration, short and
    low-depth contigs are removed iteratively with cutoff threshold from low to high to reduce the errors
    in low-depth and high-depth regions. This iterative approach compensates for the information loss with
    de bruijn graphs constructed using a single kmer length. For this reason, IDBA-UD is considered one of
    the more accurate microbial assemblers.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Known limitations:</b> IDBA-UD only works with paired-end reads, as they are are aligned to contigs
    and assembled locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions.
    </p>
    <p>IDBA version: 1.1.3.</p>
